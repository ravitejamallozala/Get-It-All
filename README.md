This is a web application build using Django python framework which acts as a platform for the users to share things, ask for required things etc.

The application allows users to post cards(items and all the information about them are called cards) about things which they can give away(unused things). Users can access cards easily as they can be looked according to categories and labels, once they find the required item they can easily look into the information in the card and fulfill their requirements.
